    "## Introduction\n",
    "Anyone who has skied or snowboarded in the past few years will almost certainly have noticed the rapid increase in lift ticket prices - what used to be 70-100 dollars a day can now reach as high as 220 or more for a single day’s lift ticket at modern, large (often Vail Resorts owned) ski resort around North America and Europe. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this investigation we plan on trying to find the link - comparing factors of many European ski resorts like Max Altitude, Min Altitude, Total Runs, Run Difficulties, Number of Lifts, Snowmaking Capacity and more to determine what factors really affect the lift ticket price the most. We will then use this data to predict lift ticket prices for new resorts to match fair market price. \n",
    "\n",
    "This will all be completed using Kaggle user thomasnibb’s “European Ski Resorts” dataset, found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thomasnibb/european-ski-resorts."
